### Amir Issaei

- From very early age I was interested to know "why". The itch of knowing "why" never subsided inside me. It only got worse as I grew up. "Why" took me to journeys I did not anticipate. Here I am to write about my "itch". As the name of the website suggests, I write about random topics. Topics will include politics, science,  Artificial Intelligence, income inequality, something that I learned recently and many more.
