### Amir Issaei

- From an early age I was interested to know "why". The itch of knowing "why" never subsided inside me. It only got worse as I grew up. "Why" took me to journeys I did not anticipate. Here I am to write about my "itch". I write about random topics. Topics may include politics, science, Artificial Intelligence or inequality. My goal is to publish at least one post per month. If you like (or do not like) the posts, write to me why or why not. I can only change what I can measure.
