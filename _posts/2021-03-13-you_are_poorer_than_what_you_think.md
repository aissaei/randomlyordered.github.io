I am a Mathematician & Engineer by training and a Data Scientist in practice. What does a Data Scientist do? Put it simply, a Data Scientist blends Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Subject matter experience to make sense of data. The role varies by industry, but the final goal of such a role is to help with a data-driven decision making. The funny thing is that I got into it accidentally. I leave the story of how I got into it for later.

I have been digging into different datasets as part of my day job and also my side projects for a long time. Since pandemic I have got interested in datasets related to economy. In general, how economy works (10,000 feet view), how money works, how Federal Reserve works, and many more "hows". I spent 2020 reading about these subjects and looking at specific data sets.

One **important** subject that is mostly known to people (and affect people's life to the great extend) is **inflation**. For those who are not familiar with inflation, the inflation rate is the percentage increase or decrease in prices during a specified period. Why is this quantity important? One line answer: high/low inflation can make or break an economy. For example, if inflation is really high, let's say 10% per year, it means the same goods you buy today will be 10% more expensive next year. So you **expect** to pay more for the same good next year. What you might think to do to overcome the inflation at least temporarily is buy many of those goods. Imagine others think the same way and they buy those goods too. The more demand (with a constant supply), the more the price of those goods. In other words, expectation of inflation itself create more inflation. Another example: if your wage does not go up with inflation, you become poorer and poorer as time goes by. There re many reasons why high inflation is not good.On the other hand, low inflation is not good (and negative inflation which Japan experienced is even worse). If you know the price of a good is going to stay the same or goes down, would you buy it now? Maybe you do maybe you do not. Usually low inflation results in low consumption. Low consumption creates other problem down the road.

For aforementioned reasons and many more, central banks try their best to **stabilize** price. In the US, Federal Reserve has two mandates:
0. Price stability
0. Maximum sustainable employment

You might ask "well these are great mandates, but how does Federal reserve achieve those?" The answer to such a question is lengthy. I will try to get into it in future. In a nutshell, Federal Reserve has many tools in its disposal to use to achieve such mandates. Keeping interest rate low, printing money, quantitate easing, etc. are some of the tools in its disposal. Of course some of these tools have/are abused through time. I will address those in future as well. Long story short, we have a entity in the U.S that is responsible to achieve above mandates by using some important **tools**.

You can only change what you measure? How does Federal reserve measure inflation? This is a difficult question to answer.
0. What goods should we take into consideration when we calculate the price change? 
0. What regions should be considered in our calculation? What time frame? 
0. The quality of life usually increases over time, how do we take that into account when we calculate the inflation? 

Simple questions are usually not straightforward. Thankfully, we have an organization in the U.S. to do answer (some) of these questions and to measure  just that. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is responsible to take these questions (and many more) into account and to measure (and report) the inflation on a regular basis. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics uses CPI to measure inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Indexes are available for the U.S. and various geographic areas.
