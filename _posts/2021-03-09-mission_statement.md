This is my first time blogging! So please bare with me along the way. It will get better (hopefully). I felt a need of blogging and in this post I would like to explain the philosophy behind:

0. Why I decided to do it?
0. What I am going to blog about?
0. And how I am going to do it?
**Note: Why, What and How are work in progress and they are subject to change.**

First things first, why? Due to my job (more on this later) I have traveled to many different countries and over 70% of the states in the US. I have met people from different background, races, ethnicity and gender. The more I talked to people, the more I felt a need for a neutral platform for people to discuss their “ideas”. I have noticed over time the “gray areas” have been fading away and polarized thoughts are replacing the gray areas. When gray area is gone, people with different ideas would not sit on the same table, would not discuss ideas (they discuss mostly characters) and most importantly they only would include “like-minded” people in their circle. I see this as not only a path to divided society, but also a danger to humanity. So here it is, this is a place where I plan to discuss ideas.

You might ask what ideas? As name of this blog suggests that it is going to be random ideas such as politics, global economy, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and the list goes on. I try to keep each post concise and to the point.

How I am going to do it? There are some rules about each post and I encourage readers to stick to those rules when they leave comments:

0. Hateful speech, racism, and any comments against human rights are not tolerated and will be removed.

0. Ideas are challenged not the characters.

0. The content of any posts/comments should be factual and backed by data/reasoning.

0. The facts might be triple checked against multiple sources before they are posted.

0. Respect must be maintained at all times.

0. Gray areas must be kept in mind at all times. We are trying to bring “opposite-minded” people to the same table to discuss “ideas”.

0. Be open to fact. If something is rational and backed by data. Do not insist that it is wrong, because it is against your biased idea.

0. Be prepared to evolve and change through time.

I would like to conclude this post with one core idea:

At least two conditions must be met to have a fruitful discussion:

0. People should seek truth and only truth

0. People should be open to change of heart

Let’s keep these two points in mind as we evolve. See you next time!
