It was March 2021 when I wrote about [inflation](https://randomlyordered.com/2021-03-13-you_are_poorer_than_what_you_are_told-copy/) and why inflation numbers presented to Americans in mainstream media and pushed to public by Federal Reserve were misleading. Here we are after 14 month from that article with price inflation soaring to 8.5% (measured by metrics defined by the Federal Reserve) and asset inflation are in mid double digits if not high. When I published that article, I started writing about two other factors that contributed to the inflation in addition to the Federal Reserve money printing policy: 1) *government spending* and 2) *supply chain bottlenecks*, but I did not end up publishing those articles due to [procrastination](https://randomlyordered.com/2022-05-07-art_of_procrastination/). In this article, however,I like to spend some time looking into Federal Reserve big failure in forecasting inflation. 



# Federal Reserve -  Incompetent institute to manage money 
I have studied Federal Reserve to a great extent and will need multiple articles to get into depth of how it works, how shady and vague it operates and why it is not an independent institute.

# Your mind always makes excuse and it is good at it
At the beginning when you skip what you promised to do, you feel bad about it. At least you feel something is missing and you should do something about it. The logical response is to correct the course and to get back to what you used to do (be it publishing a blog, going to the gym, writing songs etc.). You start analyzing why you should/shouldn't do the thing you are supposed to do and as soon as you get to that *conversation with yourself*, you enter a lost battle. Your mind always find excuses why you should/shouldn't do something. The bad news is that your mind always win. In my case, when I skipped a few blogging sessions, my mind gave me *logical* reasons of why it was okay to not do it. "Amir, you have a toddler to spend time with and it is okay to miss a week or two", "Amir, you are responsible for all of the forecasting projects at the company, it is okay to miss a few blogging sessions or two" etc. Even though I knew that I had promised myself to do something, my mind convince me that it was okay not doing it. Mind is very powerful and it wins every single time.

# Perfection
Many of us are looking for a perfect moment, perfect blog, perfect training session etc. The bad news is that there is no such a thing as perfect. It is always work in progress. In my case, I have over ten unfinished articles. Well, probably some of them are finished, but I am not happy with their flow. I think they need to be polished. I think there is something more to be added to them. That perfectionist obsession should be anchored. As long as you are looking for something perfect, you will never end up releasing the next song, blog, algorithm etc. The art of iterative process is more impactful than perfection. 

# Solution
So what is the solution? You might ask. Short answer: "just do it!". Never get to the battle with your mind and never get to that internal conversation. Stick to what you promised to yourself and just do it. Do not worry about how *imperfect* it is. Do not skip a session. Just do it.

# Me moving forward
I tame the perfectionist side of me. I stay true to myself and will not get into conversation with my mind. I will just do it. I will do it every month. 


Until next time.
